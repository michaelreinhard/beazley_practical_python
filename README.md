Dave Beazley's Practical Python course review of exercises. 

This is my attempt to re-do the exercises from Dave Beasley's one week course in Python. The exercises cover the basics of reading in data, manipulating it and putting your functions into classes. The material is also covered in Part 1 of his "Python: Essential Reference".
